## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- **Single Player Mode:** Control your angel using a joystick to move and a special roll button to dodge incoming meteors.  
- **Two Player Mode:** Two angels share the same arena:  
  - Player 1 has a **gold halo** and is controlled via the left-side joystick.  
  - Player 2 has a **silver halo** and is controlled via the right-side joystick.  
  - Roll buttons appear only when a player is alive. Player 1’s roll button is red (bottom-right), Player 2’s is blue (bottom-left).  
- **Meteor Mechanics:**  
  - Initially 3 fiery meteors fall from above, increasing to 14 over time.  
  - Meteors spawn randomly in the arena.  
- **Timer:** The top-left corner shows your angel’s avatar with “PLAYER” (or “PLAYER2”) text and survival time in seconds.  
- **Arena Hazard:** If you survive until the 300th second, flames rise from the edges. Touching the flames will kill your angel.
